# CSS-Linter-Capstone-Proyect

> Building a linter tool for css files, that checks the basic sintax of a css file and points all the mistakes that the file has. The CSS Linter checks the following rules:

 - Checks for any trailling white space at the end of a line
 - Checks if a block declaration line has more than one element
 - Checks if there's a space before the block declaration opening ( { )
 - Checks if property lines with CSS rules has a soft indentation of two spaces
 - Checks if the end of the block declaration is in a single line ( } )
 - Checks if there's a space after the colon ( : ) on a property line
 - Checks if properties are in a single line
 - Checks if the propertie line ends with a semi-colon ( ; )
 - Checks if the comma separated values in a propertie line has a space between then
 - Checks if float values that start with 0 (0.5rem) doesn't include the 0
 - Checks if there's an empty line after a block declaration ends
 - Check if there's an empty line at the end of the file

> Test suite:

- Test cases for each method built with Rspec

## Built With
